/**
 * Tic-Tac-Toe game
 *
 * This script manages the basic functionality of a Tic-Tac-Toe game in a web application.
 * Player take turns aginst computer marking Xs on a 3x3 grid with the objective of
 * aligning three of their symbols in a row to win. The script handles player
 * interactions, win conditions, and game resets and basic blocking. This game is
 * functional but very basic.
 *
 * I added detailed comments to help myself understand better.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Player turns and symbol tracking (X and O)
 * - Win condition checking for rows, columns, and diagonals
 * - Detection of a draw (cat's game) when the board is full
 * - Resetting the game for a new round
 * - Listen after feedback button submit and redirect to form.index
 * - Basic blocking.
